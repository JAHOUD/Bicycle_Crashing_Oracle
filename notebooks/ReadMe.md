**This folder** contains the notebooks corresponding to each step of our project from data exploration, visualization & preprocessing to prediction modeling.

You can find additional notebooks in the [***`other_notebooks/`***](other_notebooks) folder, which corresponds to other work that had been done but wasn't included in the final application, like TimeSeries forecasting.

#
The ***`data/`*** folder contains only the filtered dataset, wich is the only dataset you will need to use for prediction models: **Notebooks 4, 5 & 6**.


In order to execute the notebooks numbered from **0 to 3**, you will need to download the full dataset from this [**link**](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/bases-de-donnees-annuelles-des-accidents-corporels-de-la-circulation-routiere-annees-de-2005-a-2020/).
